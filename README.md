A command line interface for interacting with the temper1 sensor from PCSensor.com. Sadly, temper1 is out of production.

# Requirements
Requires nodejs v0.10.x because the node-hid dependency does not support anything higher. But they are [working on it](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid/pull/69).
